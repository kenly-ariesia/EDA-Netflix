# Netflix EDA Project

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project based on Netflix content data from 2010 to 2021. The project aims to understand how Netflix has evolved its content strategy over the years regarding genre distribution, content duration, and country of origin.

Netflix has transformed from a regional streaming service to a global streaming service that continues to grow to become a leader in digital entertainment.

This project analyzes how the growth and changes in the content provided by Netflix, ranging from changes in genre, country of origin, and 

**Goals**:
1. To explore the distribution of content genres over time
2. To identify the top contributing countries to Netflix content
3. To analyze duration trends based on content type (movies or TV shows)

**Insights**:
1. Genre Distribution: The genres of drama, comedy, and documentary have consistently grown, indicating an increasingly varied content consumption pattern as Netflix's market reach expands.
2. Country Distribution: The United States still leads in content volume, but other countries such as India, South Korea, Japan, the UK, and others are starting to increase significantly, demonstrating Netflix's global expansion strategy and content origin differentiation.
3. Duration Trend: The average season duration of TV Shows remained stable, indicating little change in consumer interest. Whereas the average duration of movies has seen a significant decline year-on-year, indicating a shift in users' content consumption patterns in favor of short, more digestible content.

**Advices**:
1.  Netflix may continue to invest in short-form movies to capture the attention of modern viewers with shorter attention spans.
2.  There's an opportunity to increase content production in emerging markets, especially where content diversity is growing.
3.  Maintaining a balance between global appeal and regional specificity will help Netflix stay ahead in the competitive streaming landscape.
